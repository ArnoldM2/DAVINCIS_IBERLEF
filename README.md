## Overview
DAVINCIS is a shared task focused on the detection of mentions of violent incidents in Twitter for Mexican Spanish.  The ultimate goal of this competition is to boost research on methods that allow the detection and monitoring of reports of violent incidents so that users can identify risk zones and authorities can build violence incidence maps.
Two editions of this task have been organised. The first edition considered 5 categories _robbery, homicide, kidnapping, accident_ and _none_ and only textual information was provided. For the second edition of the task, the considered categories where _robbery, murder, accident_ and _none_, and organisers provided text and images and encouraged the development of multimodal solutions.

In our approach, we augmented the instances of this dataset using LLMs, specifically this is vanilla implementation of the GPT API.
